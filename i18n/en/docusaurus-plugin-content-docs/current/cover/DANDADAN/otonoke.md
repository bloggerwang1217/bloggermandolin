## Video Introduction

DanDaDanDanDaDanDanDaDanDanDaDan…

Today I'm bringing you "Otonoke / Creepy Nuts", the OP of "DAN DA DAN"!

I always struggle when I encounter Rap songs. This time I decided to use a percussion style for the intro, and for the rap part, I skipped straight to the chorus! Do you like this arrangement?

Besides the regular accompaniment version, I've also made a special piano accompaniment version! (This is my little experiment to see which version people prefer - you can check out the analysis of the results here!) Please let me know in the video comments which version you prefer~ Thank you for listening! See you next time~

(Momo is so cute!)

## Lyrics Translation

### English

It possessed me, possessed me, possessed me, possessed me, possessed me
After clawing its way out, the mist has cleared
If the uneven edges could fit together smoothly
If the pains could coincide

Mind, body, head
Something is gradually surging up
If wings were to sprout on my back now
I would say goodbye to the darkness
Spread my wings and fly far away
Mind, body, head
A warm feeling that brings nostalgia
If flowers were to bloom at my feet now
I would say goodbye to the darkness
Spread my wings and fly far away
No matter how many times, I will keep living
In your heart
In your eyelids or in your ears
In the melody/rhythm that always stays deep inside the heart

### 日本語

ハイレタハイレタハイレタハイレタハイレタ
必死で這い出た先で霧は晴れた
デコとボコが上手く噛み合ったら
痛みが重なったら

ココロカラダアタマ
みなぎってゆく何だか
背中に今羽が生えたならば
暗闇からおさらば, ay
飛び立っていく彼方, ay
ココロカラダアタマ
懐かしい暖かさ
足元に今花が咲いたならば
暗闇からおさらば, ay
飛び立っていく彼方, woah!

何度だって生きる お前や君の中
瞼の裏や耳の中
胸の奥に居着いてるメロディー、リズムに
